# What is a special assignment?
A special assignment is an opportunity to deepen a student's knowledge and skills in a topic of interest after the bachelor's thesis and before the master's thesis.
A student gets 10 cr from the special assignment, which equals approximately 260 hours of workload and includes (1) the research/working at the topic, (2) writing a report, and (3) participating and presenting at the NBE student seminar (Aalto University).
